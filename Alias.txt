Alias:
Because you use the full column names when joining tables, the query can get really long. To make it easier and shorter, we can provide nicknames for our tables

SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, c.city, pn.number, pn.type FROM customers AS c JOIN PhoneNumbers AS pn


Noteworthy:
After giving the nicknames(also called table aliases), we can use them in the query, both in the select list and in the condition
