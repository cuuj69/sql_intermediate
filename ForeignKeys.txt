Another type of constraint is the Foreign Key

A foreign Key is a column in one table that refers to the Primary Key in another table

This constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables

In our case, the customer_id column in the PhoneNumbers table is the foreign key, which refers to the primary key id in the customers table


CREATE TABLE PhoneNumbers(
    id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    customer_id int NOT NULL,
    numbers varchar(55),
    type varchar(55),
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(id)
)

The Foreign Key constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the linked table
