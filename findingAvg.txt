In this lesson we will learn how to solve a slightly more complex problem- we need to find the average number of phone numbers the Customers in our table have.

To calculate the avergage, we need to find the number of phone numbers that each customer has, then use the avg function over the result set


Firstly, we join the tables

select c.id, c.firstname, c.lastname, pn.number, pn.type from Customers as c left join PhoneNumbers AS pn
ON C.id =pn.customer_id


We used a LEFT JOIN as not all customers have a phone number
This is an important point. By simply joining the tables we would get the wrong result for the average

Finding the Average


Now we can group the data based on our customers and find the number of phone numbers each of them has:

select c.id, count(pn.number) as count
from Customers as c left join PhoneNumbers AS PN ON
c.id = pn.customer_id
Group by c.id

Our custom 'count' column now has the number of phone numbers for each customer as we grouped the query by the customer id


As you can see from the results, the count also includes 0 values:
that's because we used the left join and some of the customers don't have any matching phone numbers


Now, we need to find the average of these values
For that, we need another select query over the data of the join

select avg(count) from(
    select c.id, count(pn.number) as count
    from customers as c left join phonenumbers as pn
    on c.id = pn.customer_id
    group by c.id
) As numbers


We aliased the query as 'Numbers' and selected the average value of the count column from it

By enclosing a select query in parenthesis, we are able to give it a name and use it just like a table.

It is also important to give the custom columns name aliases, so you can select them
