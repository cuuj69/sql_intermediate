Multiple Tables:

Often, data is stored in mulitple linked tables.


We can select data from multiple tables by separating them with a comma in a SELECT statement


SELECT firstname,lastname,city,number,type
FROM Customers, PhoneNumbers
WHERE Customers.id = PhoneNumbers.customer_id


Noteworthy:
The Where condition tells the SQL to combine only those rows that have corresponding customer_id
