When creating custom columns, SQL allows you to set the value based on conditions.



We want to set the category columns value to 'Senior' in case the age value is greater than 65, 'Adult' in case it's in the range of 25 to 64, and 'Youth', if it's under 25

This is done using the case statement


SELECT firstname, lastname, CASE 
WHEN age >= 65 THEN 'SENIOR' END AS category FROM Customers

The CASE statement includes the condition in the WHEN clause and sets the value using the THEN keyword




Example of a valid case:

CASE
WHEN rating >= 8 THEN 'Great'
END
