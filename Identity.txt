As we have seen, most tables we work with have a column called id which contains a number

That column is often called the identity column and is similar to a row number in excel

Often the id is an integer (a whole number) which is incremented with each new row

SQL allows you to create a column that gets automatically incremented with each new row

That is done using the AUTO_INCREMENT, the value is automatically set when new rows are inserted, without the need for us to specify it

Illustration

create table customers (
    id int not null auto_increment,
    firstname varchar(255),
    lastname varchar(255)
);



By default, the auto_increment column starts with the value 1 This can be changed if needed, using:

alter table Customers
auto_increment=555

Now, when a new row is inserted, the id column will start from the given value
