Substring

The SUBSTRING function allows you to extract part of the text in a column. it takes the starting position and the number of characters we want to extract

For example, let's take the first 3 characters of the firstname


SELECT SUBSTRING(firstname, 1,3) FROM Customers

Ohok so instead of index the SUBSTRING function takes the following arguments (column_name,starting position,number of characters)
