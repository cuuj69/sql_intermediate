The unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are different

A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint

Nb:
However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table


Altering  the lastname column of our Customers table:

ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD UNIQUE (lastname)

Nb: You can have multiple UNIQUE columns


Unique

Now when we try to insert a Customer with a lastname that is already present in the table, we will get an error:

INSERT INTO Custormes(firstname,lastname,city,age) VALUES ('demo','Anderson','London',24)



Noteworthy:
NULL values are ignored by UNIQUE, meaning you can have multiple NULL values in a UNIQUE column
