Similarly, the RIGHT JOIN returns all the rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table

select c.firstname, c.lastname, c.city, pn.number, pn.type from PhoneNumbers as pn right join customers as c on c.id=pn.customer_id order by c.id


Exercise:
Number of Books 
You are working on the library database, which contains the Books and Authors tables.

Columns of the Books table: id, name, year, author_id.

Columns of the Authors table: id, name.

 

Write a query to get the author names and the number of books they have in the Books table.

Note that some authors do not have any books associated with them. In this case, the result needs to include their names and have 0 as the count. The count column should be called books in the result.

level
Sort the result by the number of books, from highest to


select A.name, count(B.id) AS books FROM Books AS B RIGHT JOIN
Authors as A ON B.author_id = A.id
GROUP BY A.name
ORDER BY books desc

So we select A.name(Authors.name) , Count(B.id) AS FROM Books AS B(So since originally the first table is Books, and the Authors table comes subsequently) RIGHT JOIN Authors AS A ON b.author_id = A.id 
GROUP By A.name, since we want to find the summary of these author counts
