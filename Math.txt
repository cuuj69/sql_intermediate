SQL also supports basic mathematical operations

For example, let's say that we run a promotion and the customers get a discount based on their age. The discount percentage is half of the age value:


SELECT firstname, lastname, age /2 AS discount FROM Customers


Calculating the BMI values:

SELECT firstname, lastname weight/(height*height) AS bmi FROM Customers

Nb:
The BMI is equal to the weight divided by the square of the height( the values are in metric units)



SQL has many math functions

We can query the min and  max age numbers:

SELECT MAX(age) FROM Customers
SELECT MIN(age) FROM Customers


The AVG() function allows you to calculate the average value.

SELECT AVG(age) FROM  Customers



COUNT

As already established, the COUNT function is used to return the count of rows in a query.

We can combine it with a GROUP BY, to find out how many customers we have in each city

SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS ct FROM Customers GROUP BY city ORDER BY ct DESC
