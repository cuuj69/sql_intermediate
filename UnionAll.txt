UNION ALL is similar to UNION, but does not remove the duplicates

SELECT firstname, lastname, age FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT firstname, lastname, age FROM Contacts


In the advent that the other table we are concatening is short of one column we need, we can simply add them to the second select as NULL

select firstname, lastname,age,city, from customers
UNION
SELECT firstname, lastname, age, NULL FROM Contacts


Noteworthy:

We can also use other constant values for the extra columns, just remember, that the value has to have the same data type as the column of the first table


Conditions:

We can also set conditions for each select in the UNION

For example

SELECT firstname, lastname, age FROM Customers
WHERE age > 30
UNION
Select firstname, lastname, age FROM Contacts
WHERE age < 25
