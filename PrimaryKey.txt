Before looking at how the data will look in these tables, let's first create the relationship between them using keys

The primary key constraint is used to uniquely identify rows of a table

In most cases, the primary key is  the auto_increment column, so for our Customers and PhoneNumbers tables, its the id column 
it is set when creating the table

CREATE TABLE Customers(
    id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    firstname varchar(255),
    lastname varchar (255),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

Primary Key
Here are some rules for primary keys
-A primary key must contain unique values
-A primary key column cannot have NULL values
-A table can only have one primary key

Nb:This is why the auto_increment column is a good fit, as it satisfies these conditions
