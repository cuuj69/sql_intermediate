Occasionally, you might need to combine data from mulitiple similar tables into one comprehensive dataset

For example, you might have multiple tables storing Customers data and you want to combine them into one result set.

This can be done using the UNION statement

UNION:
The UNION Operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements

Consider having a Customers and Contacts tables, both having firstname lastname and age columns

SELECT firstname lastname, age FROM Customers
UNION
select firstname, lastname, age from Contacts



Nb:
All SELECT statements withing the  UNION must have the same number of columns. The columns must also have the same data types. Also, the columns in each select statement must be in the same order


UNION removes the duplicate records
